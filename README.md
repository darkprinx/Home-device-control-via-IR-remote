# Home-device-control-via-IR-remote

This a simple hardware project that controls household devices via an IR remote.For a sample use and clear understanding the project is made with 3 LED lights and 1 fan.

 ## Motivation
Though the present generation has surpassed the efficiency bound of previous technology based systems, there are still many systems remained to be developed. Modern buildings and houses are a good example of it. Basically, most used household electronics like light fan, etc. are controlled with switch buttons. The switch is controlled by pressing on it. But a situation can arise where there is a need to control the device without touching the switch button. That is, if an individual is far away from the switch that person should come forward to the switch. In case, if the person is sick or very much tired that he/she canâ€™t make it to reach to the switch, a problematic situation then arises. Moreover, the idea of pressing the switch button is not even much efficient keeping pace with the present era. Thus, this project can help an individual to control the household devices with the help of IR remote.
